# 🛳️ Titanic Survivor Prediction - Deep Neural Network

This project builds a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** using **TensorFlow + TFLearn** to predict the survival probability of Titanic passengers.  
The dataset is preprocessed (encoding categorical variables, dropping irrelevant features, normalization) before training the model.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing pipeline (sex encoding, dropping irrelevant features).
- Deep Neural Network with fully connected layers.
- Model training with accuracy tracking.
- Predictions on custom passenger inputs (e.g., Jack & Rose 😉).
